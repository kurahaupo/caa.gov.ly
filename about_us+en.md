## About Us

After accession of the Libyan State to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 1953, the administrative structure for Libyan civil aviation was founded in 1955 as the Libyan Civil Aviation Administration, to represent the legitimacy and legislative authority of the Libyan state in all forums and before local and international organizations in the field of civil aviation.

The Civil Aviation Authority is concerned with the implementation and application of the policies included in the Chicago Convention of 1944, signed by the Libyan state in 1953 when becoming a member of the International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO.

The treaty provides in the first article on the air-space that the sovereignty of the state over the region is absolute.

The Libyan State (whose area exceeds 1,750,000 km² and the whose Mediterranean coastline spans 2000 km), was part of the Malta Aviation Region, which extends from 36.30°N to 22.00°N, and from 11.30°E to around 25°E. Within this extensive air-space Malta was exercising air sovereignty over the entire Libyan territory.

However, through the efforts of national elements and personnel in the civil aviation sector, sovereignty and control of the entire Libyan airspace was established on the sixth of December 1973, with the establishment of a temporary control and information center for the territory, which trained national elements and qualified air traffic controllers to take over the reins in the management of air traffic and all the other disciplines will conduct the work of civil aviation sector.
